On **Wednesday, January 24 from 2pm-4pm @ Portland City Hall**, we will be delivering signed youth petitions to the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection. It will be on the 2nd floor of the Portland City Hall in the State of Maine Room. We understand that 2pm may be a difficult time for students, but if you can get out of school early, or arrive 15-20 minutes late, that’s still fine. We’re just trying to get as many students at the event as possible. There will be many youth speakers giving their testimonies about the importance of this legislation, and youth environmental art/posters will be presented at the event.
