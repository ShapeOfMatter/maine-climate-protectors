We have been told by our contact at DEP that a notice of public hearing will be published in late March. The public hearing will be approximately three weeks later. We are seeking individuals to speak at the hearing and/or to submit written testimony on a broad range of climate change issues, including:

 + Health implications
 + Economic impacts, e.g., on commercial fisheries, farming, forestry, aquaculture, winter sports
 + Economic opportunities, e.g., solar, wind, heat pumps, tidal
 + Ecological impacts
 + Faith/moral perspective
 + Impact on youth
