## Background: 

On Wednesday, a coalition of voters and some of Maine’s youngest citizens, who call themselves the “Maine Climate Protectors”, will file a climate change petition for rulemaking with the state’s Department of Environmental Protection, demanding that Maine protect their futures.

In a spirited, art-filled celebration rally before the filing, Maine youth will speak on the importance of acting decisively to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change.  A member of the Maine bar will address how the petition creates a path to achieve the goals set forth in the existing Maine law.

From there, the youth petitioners and their supporters will head to Maine DEP’s office on Canco Street in Portland to deliver the petition. Stand with the Maine Climate Protectors by posting with our hashtag & the suggested content in this guide.
