On May 15th, over 34 people gathered in the Maine DEP Response Training Room in Augusta to speak to DEP representatives about our proposed rules. Three of them, industrial lawyers and a saw-mill operator, spoke in opposition. The thirty one people speaking in favor were a mix of lawyers, scientists, middle-school students, high-school students, and professionals from across the state.
