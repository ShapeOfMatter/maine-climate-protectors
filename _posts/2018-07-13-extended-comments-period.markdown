The DEP has opted to extend the deadline for written comments on the [Citizen Petition for Rulemaking to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.maine.gov/dep/rules/index.html#794983 "Maine D.E.P.") until 5pm, July 30, 2018.  
It's critical that they hear from us about *why* these rules are important; see [our post about writing to them]({{ "/posts/now-is-the-time-for-written-comments/" | relative_url}} "Now is the time for written comments").
