We expect that people opposed to greenhouse gas regulations will submit their opinions in writing; it's important for us to match that. Remember that this is not a vote; the DEP wants to know *why* they should make these rules. 

Comments may be submitted in a number of formats:  
* Email comments should be submitted using [the website link](http://www.maine.gov/dep/rules/index.html#794983 "Maine D.E.P."). (although you may also submit them directly to Jeff at jeff.s.crawford@maine.gov)  
* Hard copy comments may be submitted via mail to:  
    GHG Petition Rulemaking Comments
    Attn:  Jeff Crawford
    Maine Department of Environmental Protection
    17 State House Station
    Augusta, ME  04333  
* Comments could also be delivered in person to DEP offices in Augusta [at 28 Tyson Drive](http://www.maine.gov/dep/contact/cmro.html "Map to the DEP office") or the Southern Maine Regional Office on [Canco Road, Portland](http://www.maine.gov/dep/contact/smro.html "Map to the DEP office in Portland"). Make sure to get hand-delivered testimony time-stamped if you deliver it on the 29th.

Make sure that all comments clearly state that you are commenting on the GHG Petition Rules.
