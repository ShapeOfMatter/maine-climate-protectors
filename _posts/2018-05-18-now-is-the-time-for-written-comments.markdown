We expect that people opposed to greenhouse gas regulations will submit their opinions in writing; it's important for us to match that. Remember that this is not a vote; the DEP wants to know *why* they should make these rules.

Make sure that all comments have a clear subject line:  
**_"Comment on Citizen Petition for Rulemaking to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions"_**  
Comments will not be accepted after 5pm, ~~June 29th~~ July 30. For reference, here's [the DEP's writeup](http://www.maine.gov/dep/rules/index.html#794983 "Maine D.E.P.").

Comments may be submitted in a number of formats:  
* Emails should be sent to **rulecomments.dep@maine.gov**.  
* Hard copy comments may be submitted via mail to:  
> GHG Petition Rulemaking Comments  
> Attn:  Jeff Crawford  
> Maine Department of Environmental Protection  
> 17 State House Station  
> Augusta, ME  04333  
* Comments could also be delivered in person to DEP offices in Augusta [at 28 Tyson Drive](http://www.maine.gov/dep/contact/cmro.html "Map to the DEP office") or the Southern Maine Regional Office on [Canco Road, Portland](http://www.maine.gov/dep/contact/smro.html "Map to the DEP office in Portland"). Make sure to get hand-delivered testimony time-stamped if you deliver it on the 30th.

Please do send us a copy of your comments!
