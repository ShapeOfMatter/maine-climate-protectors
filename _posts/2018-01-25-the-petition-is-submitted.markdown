The MCP, 350GP, and CCL gathered to celebrate the finalized petition and deliver it to the Department of Environmental Protection on January 24th.

Children from nearby schools spoke to the gathered crowd in the State of Maine Room at Portland City Hall about the ways climate change will affect their lives. Angus Ferguson and Beth Valentine recapped the history and legal context of the petition.

The DEP will have 60 days to begin a rule-making process in response to the petition. This is a flexable process, so it's best if you can work with us, *before this ends up in court* to [pressure the DEP to implement strong policies]({{"/posts/write-to-the-dep/" | relative_url}} "Contact the DEP").
