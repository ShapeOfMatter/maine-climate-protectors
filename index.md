In January, 2018, a group of Mainers including youth filed a revised petition for rule-making to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”). The petition asked that the DEP fulfill its constitutional, public trust, and statutory obligations to implement science-based greenhouse gas emission reductions necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and ocean acidification and protect a stable climate system for present and future generations. In light of the extreme weather events, ocean acidification, record-setting temperatures, and other climate impacts already being experienced, there is no time for Maine to delay.

In Maine, we have a 15 year old law that states that Maine will reduce greenhouse gas emissions "sufficient to eliminate any dangerous threat to the climate." So far, this law has not been implemented. **Maine Climate Protectors** has a petition requesting that the Maine Department of Environmental Protection make rules based on climate science so we can meet those goals.

As recent events have underscored---four foot rains in Texas, grid-destroying winds in Florida, record-breaking wildfires in Montana and California, and utter devastation in Puerto Rico---our future and our children’s future depends on what we do right now.
