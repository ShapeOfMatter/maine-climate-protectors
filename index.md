A group of Mainers, including youth, are preparing to file a revised petition for rulemaking to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”). The petition asks that the DEP fulfill its constitutional, public trust, and statutory obligations to implement science-based greenhouse gas emission reductions necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and ocean acidification and protect a stable climate system for present and future generations. In light of the extreme weather events, ocean acidification, record-setting temperatures, and other climate impacts already being experienced, there is no time for Maine to delay.
