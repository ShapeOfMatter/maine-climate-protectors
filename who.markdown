Over 500 Maine voters are submitting this petition asking the DEP to fulfil their legal and moral mandate.

Beth Valentine (lawyer, U-Maine?) wrote the petition with some other people?

Angus Ferguson (lawyer, ?) was inspired by the "Our Children’s' Trust" movement to fight for enforcement of existing environmental protection laws. 

Who else should we name personally?

350 Maine is some folks.

Citizen's Climate Lobby is some folks.

Our Children’s' Trust is some folks.
