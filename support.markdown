#### The principal need at this time is for people to speak at the [May 15th public hearing]({{ "/posts/dep-hearing-may-15th/" | relative_url }}) hosted by the DEP.

If you would like to coordinate with us to get to a hearing, contact Beth Valentine at {{ site.contact_email }}.

If you are too young to vote, or you know young people who would like to get involved, consider downloading our [Youth Petition Toolkit]({{ "/uploads/Youth%20Toolkit%20v1%20(2).docx" | relative_url }}). Be **certain** to email us at {{ site.contact_email }} to let us know that you're gathering signatures. 

There are many organizations in Maine and around the world working for better climate policy. We work closely with [350 Maine](http://www.350maine.org/donate) and [Our Children's Trust](https://www.ourchildrenstrust.org/donate/), both of whom could use your help with operational costs and various campaigns.  
If you would like to help with MCP's own costs, just send us a quick email and we'll get you in touch with our Treasurer.
