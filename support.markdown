If you would like to get involved in ongoing efforts, contact Beth Valentine at {{ site.contact_email }}.

We're looking forward to the DEP coming under new leadership as our new Governor is inaugurated, and the Legislative sessions look promising too. There will be ways coming up that we'll need your help personally, and we can also get you in touch with other people and groups of people in your area who are working to save the world from climate change.

There are many organizations in Maine and around the world working for better climate policy. We work closely with [350 Maine](http://www.350maine.org/donate) and [Our Children's Trust](https://www.ourchildrenstrust.org/donate/), both of whom could use your help with operational costs and various campaigns.  
If you would like to help with MCP's own costs, just send us a quick email and we'll get you in touch with our Treasurer.
