#### The principal need at this time is for people to speak at an as-yet unscheduled public hearing hosted by the DEP.

Ask Jeff Crawford at the DEP to inform you or your group when the hearing is scheduled. You can email him at `jeff.s.crawford@maine.gov`; you can use the below sample text, or print out [this postcard]({{ "/uploads/postcard%20to%20dep%2020180202a.pdf" | relative_url }}) if you prefer to use paper mail. A more personalized message is always appropriate too!  
    Jeff Crawford of the Maine D.E.P. Bureau of Air Quality;
    Climate change driven by our emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is already having negative effects in Maine. Without strong, immediate action our natural resources will be devastated, our health will suffer, and our economy will follow close behind. The time has come to wean ourselves of fossil fuels, and your agency is empowered to play a key role. 
    I understand that the DEP will be holding a public hearing to address rulemaking under Maine's climate protection statute (38  M.R.S.A. ยง576(3)). Please notify me of the date, time and location of the hearing at this address.
    Thank you;
    [your name]  
Do note that the DEP requires a fee for paper notifications.

If you would like to coordinate with us to get to a hearing, contact Beth Valentine at {{ site.contact_email }}.

If you are too young to vote, or you know young people who would like to get involved, consider downloading our [Youth Petition Toolkit]({{ "/uploads/Youth%20Toolkit%20v1%20(2).docx" | relative_url }}). Be **certain** to email us at {{ site.contact_email }} to let us know that you're gathering signatures. 

There are many organizations in Maine and around the world working for better climate policy. We work closely with [350 Maine](http://www.350maine.org/donate) and [Our Children's Trust](https://www.ourchildrenstrust.org/donate/), both of whom could use your help with operational costs and various campaigns.  
If you would like to help with MCP's own costs, just send us a quick email and we'll get you in touch with our Treasurer.
