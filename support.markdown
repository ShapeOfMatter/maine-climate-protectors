There are many organizations in Maine and around the world working for better climate policy. We work closely with [350 Maine](http://www.350maine.org/donate) and [Our Children's Trust](https://www.ourchildrenstrust.org/donate/), both of whom could use your help with operational costs and various campaigns. 

If you'd like to help with our current work lobbying the DEP, there are a few things you can do:
 + [Write to the DEP to express your support.]({{ "/posts/write-to-the-dep/" | relative_url }})
 + Reach out to us and tell us we're doing a good job. Maybe we'll know of ways for you to help us. {{ site.contact_email }}
 + Contact your legislators and the Governor to express your support. They're the bosses of the DEP!
